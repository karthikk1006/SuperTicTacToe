**Welcome to Super Tic Tac Toe!**

Tired of the same old, plain Tic Tac Toe? Welcome to Super Tic Tac Toe – where simplicity meets strategy, and the classic game gets a modern makeover. Adding more mini Tic Tac Toe grids doesn't just amp up the challenge; it takes the fun to a whole new level.

## Rules:

- X goes first and can play in any of the empty spots on the global board!

- Now it is O’s turn, but O does not get to pick which of the 9 local boards they will play on. Whichever square within a local board your opponent plays on determines the next local board that you must play on (if X plays in the bottom right square of their local board, then O has to play in the local board at the bottom right of the global board).

- When you get three in a row on a local board, you’ve won that board and the board is no longer in play. Mark that board with a large X or O (whichever letter won the board). If there is a draw in a local board, it is represented by a D.

- If a local board has already been won and you are “sent” there, you can choose to play on any local board that is still available. So try to avoid sending your opponent to an already won local board.

- To win the game, you need to win three local boards in a row.
